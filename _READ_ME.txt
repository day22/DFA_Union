This program takes reads two DFAs from separate input files and writes the union to an output file. 
The main method is located within the class DFA_UNION. All the java files within this package must be 
compiled in order for the program to run functionally. 

Union algorithm description:
Declares a new DFA object to be the resultant union of the two argument DFAs. States of the union are generated by the cross product
of the states in the two intial dfas. Union alphabet is read from the first DFA, we assume both inputed DFAs have the same alphabet. 
Start state is the concatination of the two DFA start states. Accept states are produced by first concatinating all possible accept states 
from the first DFA with all states in the second DFA. The same is done with the second DFA with checking for duplicates. The algorithm then
returns the DFA we just initialized. 

Input files take the form of the classic DFA fivetuple:
The first line should contain states separate with commas. No spaces should be placed after commas. Ex: q1,q2,q3 
Second line should contain the alphabet separate with commas. Ex: 0,1
Third line should contain the delta table of the DFA. Connections take the following form (originState) (input) (endState). Example: q0 0 q1 
Forth line should contain soly the starting state. EX q1
Fifth line should contain the accept states of the DFA separated with commas. No spaces should be placed after commas. Ex: q1, q2

Example file:
q1,q2
0,1
q1 0 q1;q1 1 q2;q2 0 q2; q2 1 q1
q1
q1

To run your own DFAs, format files as show and then make the following changes to main:

DFA dfa1 = new DFA("(insert your file name here)");

DFA dfa2 = new DFA("(insert your file name here)");

After you have made those changes the resultant union will be written to the output file in the same fivetuple form
